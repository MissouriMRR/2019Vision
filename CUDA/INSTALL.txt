## CUDA Installation Instructions
For any operating system, to run CUDA you will need an NVIDIA graphics card as
well as the corresponding NVIDIA drivers.

# Linux
	sudo apt-get nvidia-cuda-toolkit

# Windows / Mac
	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
	Verify cuda/v10.x/bin is in path.

After installing the toolkit, run the hello world program and ensure the
output is 'Hello World!'. If it is not, ensure nvidia drivers are active,
restart your terminal and maybe even your whole PC.
