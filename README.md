# 2019Vision
Collaboration!

Goal is to have groups of people collaborate to create a larger scale project than any one person would be able to alone.

## Git
Getting remote repo on local pc
* cd <directory&gt;  # Change into a directory you want the folder in
* git clone <url&gt;  # Download the remote repository to local pc

Before working
* git pull  # pull other peoples work to your local machine
* <edit code&gt;
* git status  # see what git sees
* git add <files you want updated on repo&gt;
* git commit -m "Description of changes here."
* git push  # push your updates to the remote repo

## SCRUM
* Ensure necessary tasks are being completed.
* Most people work alone but then code all comes together at end.
* Create branches to Isolate code
* * git checkout -b feature/<featurename&gt;  # When creating novel code
* * git checkout -b hotfix/<hotfixname&gt;  # When combining / patching features
* Switch between branches
* * git checkout <feature/hotfix&gt;/<branchname&gt;

## Unit testing
Ensure every feature responds to input the way you expect _in an automated way._

[Python unit testing library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

Create robust unit tests so when you change your code, unit tests do not need to change much.

## Project Ideas

# TODO - Link everythin

Interested in Autonomy?

* Create an ant simulator where all of the ants think independantly with simple logic and create complex emergent behaviors.

Interested in writing code for the Graphics Card?

* Write a voroni tesselation program in OpenCL

Interested in more complex Computer Vision?

* Track cells w/ blob tracking.

* Identify objects in space with shape detection[or something else cool].

Interested in Machine Learning?
 
* Make a handwritten digit classifier w/ K-Nearest Neighbors, and upgrade it to a Neural Network!

* Create a reinforcement learning algorithm to play ...!
