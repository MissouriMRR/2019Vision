# Text Color Predictor Shell
This is a shell for writing a learning background color chooser for any given text color.

## Requirements
python -m pip install pygame

## Configuration
Create from background_optimizer class create the object TextColorChooser.

Parameter List

    density: int, default=16
        How far of a gap between rgb values.
        
    map_size: tuple(int), default=(0,256) 
        Either a size 2 tuple of min and max for all colors or a size 6 tuple of
        min and max for each of red, green and blue.

## Operating
Program executes in three steps.
1. Get user data(done for you)
2. Use user data to predict for all values(implement in predictor.py)

###############

Step 1: Get user data

Create class TextColorChooser.

Then 
- Use GUI to input choices on which color text works best for background. 

Step 2: Predict for all colors
Create your own predictor in predictor.py.

Generate data for all colors by calling class.complete_data() or the class.data property.
Data is generated by weighing the colors by the distance they are from the point.

Data is sent in format

    (color(int, int, int), value(string))
    Color is rgb value
    Value is 'w' for white or 'b' for black
    Value has x as first letter if is user inputted value
